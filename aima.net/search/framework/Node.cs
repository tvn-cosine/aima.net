     * Figure 3.10 Nodes are the data structures from which the search tree is
     * constructed. Each has a parent, a state, and various bookkeeping fields.
     * Arrows point from child to parent.<br>
     * <br>
     * Search algorithms require a data structure to keep track of the search tree
     * that is being constructed. For each node n of the tree, we have a structure
     * that contains four components:
     * <ul>
     * <li>n.STATE: the state in the state space to which the node corresponds;</li>
     * <li>n.PARENT: the node in the search tree that generated this node;</li>
     * <li>n.ACTION: the action that was applied to the parent to generate the node;
     * </li>
     * <li>n.PATH-COST: the cost, traditionally denoted by g(n), of the path from
     * the initial state to the node, as indicated by the parent pointers.</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param <S> The type used to represent states
     * @param <A> The type of the actions to be used to navigate through the state space
